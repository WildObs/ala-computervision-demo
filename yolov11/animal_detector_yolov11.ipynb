    "# WildObs Tech Demo: Using YoloV11 for Australian Animal Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "WildObs is a new national platform that will provide and end-to-end solution for wildlife monitoring in Australia. One of its key features is the ability to automatically detect Australian animals in images. For this, the WildObs team is developing the next generation of Australia's animal detection models using existing national and international tools.\n",

    "In this notebook, we use the powerful image hosting services of the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the new YoloV11 model to demonstrate how to use a base model to detect Australian animals in images. Let's see how good is this model at detecting an iconic Australian animal, the echidna"
