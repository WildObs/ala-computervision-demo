- WildObs Tech Demo 1: ALA v YoloV11 (yolov11)

    - Released 2 months ago, YoloV11 is the newest version of the Yolo object detection algorithm. It is faster and more accurate than the previous versions. We test this new foundational model on echinas and see how it performs ðŸ§¸
    - The `animal_detector_yolov11.ipynb` downloads the images using the `galah` packages and then we show how to run the YoloV11 model on the images
    - The `download_images.R` script downloads the images using the `galah` package using R. This script was used when the `galah` package was not able to download images. 

- WildObs Tech Demo 2: ALA v Yolo-World (yoloworld)
    - Released earlier in 2024, Yolo-World is a an adaptation of the Yolo object detection algorithm for vision-language queries. The user can use text to ask for the model to detect specific objects in the images without previous training. We test this new model on 3 images of varying complexities and see how it performs
